## Overview

Web3 offers a unique authentication method using Web3 wallets. This method eliminates the need for traditional email login and provides a secure and private way for developers to implement authentication for users on their platforms.
In this example, we will explore how to use Solana wallets to create and sign messages, and verify their signatures in the back-end or we can use decentralized identifier (DID).


## What You Will Do 
In this guide, we will create a simple React app, that allow you authenticate user’s.
- Setting your react app.
- Implement front-end user interface.
- Integrate the Solana Wallet extension (e.g., Phantom).
- Create user identifier function with user’s wallet.
- Implement back-end APIs.

## What You Will Need 
To follow along with this guide, you will need the following:
- Basic knowledge of the JavaScript, TypeScript, and React programming languages.
- Nodejs installed (version 16.15 or higher)
- npm or yarn installed (We will be using yarn to initialize our project and install the necessary packages. Feel free to use npm instead if that is your preferred package manager)
- A modern browser with a Solana Wallet extension installed (e.g., Phantom)

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was how we can bundle and deploy module to go live. The solution was read and follow reference of the similar project.
